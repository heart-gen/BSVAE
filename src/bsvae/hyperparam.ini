# DEPRECATED
#
# This file is kept only for backward compatibility with legacy scripts.
# The active CLI (`bsvae-train` from `bsvae.cli.train`) does NOT read this file.
#
# Configure runs via CLI flags instead:
#   bsvae-train NAME --dataset PATH [options]
#
# See docs/cli.md and docs/hyperparameters.md for the supported options.
